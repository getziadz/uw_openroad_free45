# DESIGN SETUP
# ------------
# Setup the flow to build the desired design.
#===============================================================================

# Setup the design directory. This is the directory where your design resides.
# Designs must adhere to a particular structure such that the flow may find all
# the required information. For more information, please read the "???" section
# in the README.
export DESIGN_DIR := $(TOP_DIR)/examples/opdb/dynamic_node/NETWORK_2dmesh

# Include the design configuration file. This usually lives in you design
# directory. For more information, please read the "???" section in the README.
include $(DESIGN_DIR)/mk/uw_free45.config.mk

#===============================================================================
# COMMERCIAL CAD TOOL SETUP
# -------------------------
# These tools are only required to convert designs using bsg_sv2v and to run
# signoff DRC/LVS. If you have a design that does not need converting and you
# do not want to run signoff DRC/LVS then you do not need to setup these tools.
#===============================================================================

# For BSG Users
# -------------
# Use bsg_cadenv (placed one directory up) to setup all of our cad tools. No
# additional setup required, ignore the variables below.

-include $(TOP_DIR)/../bsg_cadenv/cadenv.mk

# to their appropriate values for your machine.
